<br>This is an example website, inspired by the 80s.
<br>Or something. It's what the kids like nowadays.
<br>So this is example text, and as you can tell, I've put a LOT of love into this!
<br>Love is important for your code to shine, don't you agree?
<br>I even put love into the custom pixel art gif background animation! It's great.<br><br>

<br>- hover opacity and styling 
<br>- cohesive design
<br>- formatting
